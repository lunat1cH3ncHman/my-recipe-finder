<p>In order to access certain Services, you may be required to provide information about yourself (such as identification or contact details) as part of the registration process for the Service, or as part of your continued use of the Services. You agree that any registration information you give to SatsumaSpoon will always be accurate, correct and up to date.

<p>You understand that all information (such as data files, written text, computer software, music, audio files or other sounds, photographs, videos or other images) which you may have access to as part of, or through your use of, the Services are the sole responsibility of the person from which such content originated. All such information is referred to below as the “Content”.

You further acknowledge that the Services may contain information which is designated confidential by SatsumaSpoon and that you shall not disclose such information without SatsumaSpoon’s prior written consent. Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with SatsumaSpoon, nothing in the Terms gives you a right to use any of SatsumaSpoon’s trade names, trade marks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features.

You agree that you shall not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trade mark notices) which may be affixed to or contained within the Services. Unless you have been expressly authorized to do so in writing by SatsumaSpoon, you agree that in using the Services, you will not use any trade mark, service mark, trade name, logo of any company or organization in a way that is likely or intended to cause confusion about the owner or authorized user of such marks, names or logos.

You and SatsumaSpoon agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within England, United Kingdom to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms. Notwithstanding this, you agree that SatsumaSpoon shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.</p>

However, it is hard to guarantee what exactly is presented on other websites or where links elsewhere may lead. SatsumaSpoon is not responsible for the content, practices, or information provided or requested on websites operated by third parties.

</p>
<p>Security</p>
<p>The importance of security for all Personal Information associated with visitors to our website is of utmost concern to us. SatsumaSpoon exercises great care and implements a variety of technologies in an effort to help make the SatsumaSpoon website secure against unauthorized access and to protect the Personal Information visitors choose to provide to us. SatsumaSpoon periodically reviews and updates these measures. Unfortunately, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be secure, and SatsumaSpoon cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers. As a result, while SatsumaSpoon strives to protect a visitor's Personal Information, SatsumaSpoon cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to us or from our online products or services, and a visitor does so at his/her own risk. SatsumaSpoon uses the industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption when credit card information is transmitted to us.

<p>If you contact us by email or a "contact us" or similar feature on our website, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure. A third party could view information you send by these methods in transit.

You may be able to create an account on our website with a username and password. If so, you are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your account password, and you shall be responsible for any access to or use of the website by you or any person or entity using your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by or on behalf of you, and whether or not such person or entity is your employee or agent. You agree to (a) immediately notify SatsumaSpoon of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. It is your sole responsibility to control the dissemination and use of your password, control access to and use of your account, and notify SatsumaSpoon when you desire to cancel your account on this website. We will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this provision.

We will have no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission.

In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your email address, we may notify you by email. You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification.

<p>Phishing</p>
<p>With identity theft a continuing problem, it has become increasingly common for unauthorized individuals to send e-mail messages to consumers, purporting to represent a legitimate company such as a bank or online merchant, requesting that the consumer provide personal, often sensitive information. Sometimes, the domain name of the e-mail address from which the email appears to have been sent, and the domain name of the website requesting such information, appears to be the domain name of a legitimate, trusted company. In reality, such sensitive information is received by an unauthorized individual to be used for purposes of identity theft. This illegal activity has come to be known as "phishing."

If you receive an e-mail or other correspondence requesting that you provide any sensitive information (including your website password or credit card information) via e-mail or to a Website that does not seem to be affiliated with our website, or that otherwise seems suspicious to you, please do not provide such information, and report such request to us at support@SatsumaSpoon.com.
